LM highest average RGR @ high nutrients (all species treatments) 

LM, SP, and WB RGR is higher in respective monoculture than in polyculture 

WB has negative average RGR @ low nutrients (all species treatments) 

LM & WB have highest maximum RGR @ high nutrients 

LM increases relative to SP @ both high and low nutrients (LMSP treatment) 

LM increases relative to WB @ both high and low nutrients (LMWB treatment) 

SP increases realtive to WB @ low (and maybe high nutrients) (SPWB treatment) 

WB losses out in all interspecific interaction @ both high & low nutrients (LMSPWB, LMWB, and SPWB treatments)
