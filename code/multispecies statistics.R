# Response: Area 
# Is final (day 10) standardized area different between species*nutrient treatments? (ANOVA)
# Is final (day 10) standardized area different between species richnesses? (harder to do this - how do I group? average?)

# Response: Relative growth rates 
# Within each species, is average average RGR different betweeen species*nutrient treatments? (ANOVA)
# Within each species, is average maximum RGR different betweeen species*nutrient treatments? (ANOVA)
# Is the average density-specific RGR different different between species?
